 The company, and a few others like it, offers investors a chance to buy
 a stake in pending lawsuits. The new crowd-funding idea came about when
 TrialFunder’s founding members were looking for a method to assist 
plaintiffs who needed funds to pay legal fees.</p><p>The way it works: TrialFunder (TF) accepts a client for a funding 
campaign. They place all the data about the case on their website. This 
includes all court documentation, police reports, any pre-trial 
testimony that has been entered into the record, and other important 
information that might have an impact on the outcome of the eventual 
trial or the pre-trial settlement.</p><p>Right now, TF invites “accredited investors” to take part in the 
funding of particular cases. Pending legislation would change that 
restriction and average investors would be able to put their cash on the
 line and get a piece of the settlement action.</p><p>A visit to TrialFunder’s website is instructive. Investors can review
 all the cases that are open for investing. The company plainly states 
that there are inherent risks involved. Any case may end up settling for
 a miniscule amount of money or for nothing at all. Others might settle 
for many millions of dollars. TrialFunder claims that the average return
 on one of its cases is quite high. This is apparently due to the fact 
that the company meticulously examines each potential lawsuit before 
accepting it as a potential investment vehicle.</p><p>Indeed, many cases settle out of court when defendants realize that a
 company like TrialFunder has listed it for financial backing. This 
tactic typically scares defendants into settling because, the reasoning 
goes, they are reluctant to go to court against a plaintiff who has firm
 financial backing.</p><picture>
